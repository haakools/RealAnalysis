## Real Analysis Course

This github is for the collection of notes and textbook relating to the Real Analysis course MAT2400 at the University of Oslo, Spring 2022. 

The main PDF document will consist of boiled down LaTeX notes following the textbook Lindstr√∏m 20xx. 

The aim of this document are several. 

The collection of the most important and central aspects as a sort of dictionary is believed to greatly enhance the learning process. 

This will also help both my GitHub and LaTeX skills in commiting regularly throughout the semester.

And lastly honing soft skills by doing constructive writing, communicating techincal aspects and simplifying abstract concepts.

# Note:
Many defintions will be verbatum of what is written in the textbook. However tweaks and additional statements which is found to give a better insight is included.
